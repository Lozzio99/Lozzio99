- **Thesis Odyssey**: Navigating the neural waves with my thesis on "Excitability in Neuromorphic Photonics" - making light do the thinking!

### 😂 Fun Stuff

- **Error 404: Sleep Not Found**: Embracing the coder's life, where sleep is a mythical creature.
- **Ctrl+Z is My Superpower**: Accidentally deleted a crucial file? No worries, I got the undo magic!
